# 👋 Hi, I'm Shanaka Fernando  
**Software QE Architect | AI-Augmented Test Automation | AWS | DevOps**

I’m a **Software Quality Engineering Architect & Consultant** with over 20 years of experience designing scalable, high-impact automation ecosystems across Web, API, and Mobile platforms.  
My current focus is on **AI-augmented QA practices** — integrating LLMs, RAG systems, and intelligent agents into modern DevOps pipelines to enhance productivity, accuracy, and release velocity.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- **Test Automation Architecture:** Playwright, Selenium, Appium, Cypress, RestAssured  
  Design and maintain enterprise-grade E2E BDD frameworks for scalable web and mobile automation.

- **Performance Testing:** JMeter, K6, LoadRunner  
  Build and optimize performance testing frameworks for multi-environment and CI/CD-integrated load testing.

- **AI-Augmented QA:** RAGAS, DeepEval, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Claude, GPT, Bedrock  
  Develop intelligent QA assistants, local RAG systems, and voice-driven AI agents to enhance coverage and analysis.

- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Moon Grid, CI/CD automation  
  Integrate testing pipelines into cloud-native architectures with distributed and parallel execution support.

- **Programming:** Java, TypeScript, Python, C#, Groovy  
  Deliver full-stack automation and backend tooling across multiple programming environments.

- **Collaboration:** Mentoring distributed QA teams, embedding AI in QA practices  
  Lead, coach, and enable QA teams to adopt modern frameworks and AI-driven quality strategies.

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I believe the best QA Architects **write their own tests** — architecture is powerful only when it’s hands-on.
